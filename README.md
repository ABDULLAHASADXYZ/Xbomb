Auto-Paste and Enter Automation Tool

This is a simple Bash script designed for automating the process of pasting clipboard content and pressing the "Enter" key at regular intervals. It uses the xdotool utility to simulate keyboard events, specifically Ctrl + V (paste) followed by the Enter key.
Features:

    Simulates the action of pasting clipboard content (Ctrl + V).
    Automatically presses Enter after each paste.
    Configurable to repeat the process a specified number of times with a delay between each action.
    Ideal for automating repetitive tasks that require pasting and confirming (e.g., testing or educational use).

Prerequisites:

    xdotool must be installed.

You can install xdotool using the following command:

sudo apt-get install xdotool
